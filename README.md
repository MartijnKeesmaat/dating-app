# Dating app feature
For this project I will work on a feature of an dating app. The design of the feature is presented below. When clicked on a button a modal will open. In this modal you will see a series of two photo's. You pick one the images that resonate the most with you and move on. Once you completed the series you can send this series to someone you might like. The goal of this feature is to have an easier way to start a conversation with others.
